The Resque::Failure API presently suffers from a lot of problems. Here are some of the major ones:

* **Too many singletons**: Have a look through [failure.rb](https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/master/lib/resque/failure.rb) and [failure/base.rb](https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/master/lib/resque/failure/base.rb) and you will notice that the API is almost exclusively singletons. There are hardly any instance methods (`base.rb` defines a `#save` method and that's really it)
* **Failures aren't objects**: There's a clear reason why there are so many singletons: when you ask for a failure, what you get back isn't a Resque::Failure object. It's just a JSON blob parsed into hash literals. Want to know anything about the failure? You have to dig through the JSON structure, which depending on where it originated from (lots of people like implementing Resque-alikes in other languages) may or may not have the elements you care about. IMO, when you ask for a failure, you should get a Resque::Failure object.
* **Failures don't have unique IDs**: I think that every failure should be identified by a unique ID (similar to a primary key) and that all APIs should accept these IDs. I have done some work with the existing code to try to facilitate this, but the API isn't great.
* **Too many arguments**: Looking at [failure.rb#79](https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/1-x-stable/lib/resque/failure.rb#L79), `Resque::Failure#each` already takes 5 arguments. This seems like a pretty clear candidate for an options hash.
* **Wacky APIs**: For whatever reason, by default [Resque::Failure.all](https://github.com/resque/resque/blob/1-x-stable/lib/resque/failure.rb#L79) only returns one failure object (as a parsed JSON blob). To actually return all failures, we need to consult `Resque::Failure.count` first, then pass that into `Resque::Failure#all`. It seems pretty clear to me this API is in need of some love.
