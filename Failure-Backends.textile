Resque ships with Redis and "Airbrake":http://airbrake.io/ failure backends, but you can add your own.

* "Email":http://gist.github.com/291329
* "Email via exception_notification for Rails":https://github.com/akshayrawat/resque_exception_notification - Sends data via the [exception_notification](https://github.com/smartinez87/exception_notification) gem.
* "Syslog":http://gist.github.com/1779106
* "Custom":http://gist.github.com/299477
* "Coalmine":https://github.com/Fatsoma/resque_coalmine_gem - Sends data to "Coalmine":https://www.getcoalmine.com/
* "Exceptional":http://github.com/lantins/resque-exceptional - Sends data to "Exceptional":http://www.getexceptional.com/

Using multiple failure backends is also useful. For example, you may want to get an Airbrake notification and be able to view the same exception under the 'Failed' tab in ResqueWeb.  To use multiple failure backends, add something like the following to an initializer, rake task, or whatever:

pre. require 'resque/failure/multiple'
require 'resque/failure/airbrake'
require 'resque/failure/redis'
Resque::Failure::Airbrake.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'fc49503482dec7bf13eda286c99ab2bf'
  config.secure = true # only set this to true if you are on a paid Airbrake plan
end
Resque::Failure::Multiple.classes = [Resque::Failure::Redis, Resque::Failure::Airbrake]
Resque::Failure.backend = Resque::Failure::Multiple
