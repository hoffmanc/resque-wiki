# Ideas

* Support spawning `resque:workers` for multiple apps.
* Support loading custom environment variables from a config file within each app.
* Support tracking pids in `/var/run/resque`.
* Automatically detect presence of a `Gemfile.lock` and invoke `bundle exec`.
* Target Ubuntu 12 LTS at first.
